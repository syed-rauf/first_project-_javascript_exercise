      // Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
      // Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
      // • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.
      // If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

      // • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
      //  (The version that fails will have no output.)
