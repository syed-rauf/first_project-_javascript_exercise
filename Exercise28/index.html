      // Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
      // Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website.
      // Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
      // • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
      //   would you like to see a status report?

      // • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
