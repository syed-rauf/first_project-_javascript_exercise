      //   Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
      // • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

      // • Make another list of five usernames called new_users.
      // Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

      // • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used.
      //  If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username.
      //  If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

      // • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive.
      // If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.
