      //   Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
      //   The function should take in an artist name and an album title,
      //   and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
      //   Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
      //   Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
      //   Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
      //   If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
      //   Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

      function make_album(artist, title, tracks = 1) {
        const album = {
          artist,
          title,
          tracks,
        };

        return album;
